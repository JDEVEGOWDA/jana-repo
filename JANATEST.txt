We saw a considerable jump in survey responses for all of DFSI, from 24% last week to 45% this week. Trackside, it has been interesting to see the gradual take-up of the survey across DFSI.
At the Division level, SDI was slow out of the blocks but has put in a stellar performance to come from behind to take the lead, increasing from 20% last week to 74% this week. 
Fair Trading and OSR have shown a consistently strong pace throughout and are neck and neck at 54% and 53% respectively.
